# LightNexus (Beta 2)
Simple installer for polishing MATE (on Arch Linux) that:
 - Installs extra repositories for easy finding of applications using the help of Chaotic AUR.
 - Installs bare essentials, like: Chromium, LibreOffice, VLC.
 - Beautifies MATE with CutefishOS wallpapers, basic Compiz animations, BriskMenu and Yaru theme components.

(Photo attached is a hand-made installation of LightNexus, soon to be turned into a simple script that does everything in 1 shot.)

This project was initially made as a way for me to simplify installing and pre-configuring MATE to feel similar as üçé, yet looking unique in its own way and also using least resources as possible. (Tested on a HP ProBook 6530b, made in 2008, running a Core 2 Duo P8400 with 4GB RAM with no issues)

Minimum system requirements:
 - Root access
 - 64-bit CPU/SOC
 - 2 GB of RAM
 - 16 GB of space (After installation, the whole OS, uncleaned takes up 8GB, so having some headroom would be nice)
 - Internet connectivity (only for the installation and web browsing)

The script needs to be transferred over a USB stick or downloading it with wget.
